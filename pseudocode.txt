// Layout HTML while thinking about how to best insert into the page through the quiz 

// Create new HTML file with reusable elements such as:

// // 1. Question container
// // 2. Initials container
// // 3. Timer container

// Think about how to best insert these elements into the page through the quiz??

// Create a new JS file with elements such as:

// // 1. Variables to keep track of quiz state
// // 2. Variables to reference DOM elements/elements to be created
// // 3. Sound effects (if you wanna get fancy)         
// // 4. Functions to start quiz, get question, and check answer, control the timer
// // 5. Function to save high scores to local storage

// Think about how to best format your files, should you put all of your JS in one file or divide it up into multiple by usecase??
